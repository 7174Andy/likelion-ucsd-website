# Web Development Basics

1. Understanding the concepts of web development, web browsers, and web pages
2. Understanding the client-server relationship, frontend, and backend

## What is Web Development?

> Web development is the work involved in developing a website for the Internet (World Wide Web) or an intranet (a private network) -wikipedia

Web development refers to the entire process of creating a website that allows users on the Internet (or an intranet) to visit and use specific features → It's all about building websites!

## Web Browser and URL

To understand websites, you first need to understand what web browsers and URLs are.

- **Web Browser**: A program that allows users to access and read information on the web. Examples: Chrome, Edge, Firefox
- **URL (Uniform Resource Locator)**: The address of websites, representing the unique location of information on the web.

## Website vs Web Page

A website is a collection of multiple web pages forming an overall online domain, while a web page is an individual document within a website.

## Client vs Server

The relationship between a client and a server is like that of a service requester and a service provider. A simple analogy would be that the client is the customer in a restaurant, and the server is the kitchen of the restaurant.

- **Client**: The entity that requests services, typically accessed through web browsers or mobile apps. It implements visual elements and user interfaces using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Clients send requests to the server and display the received data visually for the user.
- **Server**: The system that responds to the client's requests by providing the necessary services or data. It handles tasks like web pages, file access, database operations, and user authentication using server-side programming languages such as PHP, Python, Java, or Ruby.

Websites store their resources (e.g., web pages, images, videos) on "server computers" to make them accessible to others. These computers run "server programs" to manage the resources and deliver them to users over a network. This program responds to user requests and provides appropriate web pages and resources. Collectively, these components are referred to as the "web server."

The counterpart to the web server is the "client," which refers to the user or the user's computer accessing the web server via an internet-connected computer. Users connect to the web server using a web browser and attempt to access a specific website by entering a URL. The web server detects these requests and responds by allowing the client to access the website. This process facilitates the exchange of data and information over the Internet.

## Frontend

Frontend development involves working on the client side. It focuses on implementing the visual elements and interfaces of web pages that users interact with directly. Technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are used to dynamically provide content based on user requests and enhance the user experience. Frontend developers are responsible for creating the "face" of the website, playing a crucial role in making the first impression on users.

## Backend

Backend development deals with server-side components like web servers, databases, and server programs. It handles the logic for processing client requests, storing or retrieving necessary data, and implementing server-side functionalities using programming languages like PHP, Python, or Java. The backend ensures the functionality and reliability of the website while complementing the frontend.

**Users cannot see or recognize the backend. Its role is to support and complement the frontend.**
